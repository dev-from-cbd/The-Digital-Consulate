## The Digital Front End Developer Exercise

I blow you away with an awesome looking & responsive page layout using HTML, SCSS, and JS that is based on the provided Wireframe. 

#### The wireframe is rough is purposefully open ended - what I do is up to me. It was not require backend functionalty i.e. the contact form does not need to be connected to a backend service.

The only requirement were that the 5 sections below are in the page I create, how they show up, how they look or what order they appear is up to me!

* Header
* About us
* Services
* Contact us
* Footer 

#### Notes
* I feel free to explore responsive concepts with the menu and other elements I feel might need it. 
* I have full creative control, if I don't like the way the wireframe's menu is laid out, change it and show you how it's supposed to be done.
* I may use any libraries, frameworks or tools I like.
* There is no requirement for a back end, however I can add one if I feel it's necessary.
* Custom fonts, crazy CSS tricks, eye catching animations etc aren't required but will go a long way to impressing you!

### Files Contained
- Wireframe images for each section;
- Logo.

### Result should include
- HTML5 output file;
- SCSS source file(s);
- Resulting CSS file;
- Any javascript files used.

In short, it can be anything - I spent as much time as I want.

The bolder the better.
